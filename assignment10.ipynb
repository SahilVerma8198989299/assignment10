    "Multithreading in Python refers to the ability to run multiple threads concurrently within a single program. A thread is a sequence of instructions that can be executed independently by the CPU. Multithreading allows different parts of a program to execute concurrently, potentially improving performance and responsiveness.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multithreading is used in Python to perform concurrent and parallel processing. It is particularly useful when dealing with tasks that involve blocking operations, such as I/O operations or waiting for external resources. By running tasks concurrently, you can make better use of available resources and potentially reduce overall execution time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary module used to handle threads in Python is the threading module. It provides a high-level interface for creating and managing threads in Python programs. The threading module allows you to create threads, start them, and synchronize their execution using locks, events, conditions, and other synchronization primitives. It also provides mechanisms for communication and data sharing between threads.\n",
